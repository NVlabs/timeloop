# Unit Tests
## Setup
1. First, copy the files from the directories beginning with 00, 01, and 02 in 
the following linked [repo](https://github.com/Accelergy-Project/timeloop-accelergy-exercises/tree/master/workspace/exercises/2020.ispass/timeloop).
2. Then, move every YAML file one folder up, in accordance to how they're structured
in the FILES variable in test-compound-config.cpp.
3. In order to use the unit tests library, please compile Timeloop as normal.
4. Then, run ```$ ./bin/timeloop-unit-tests```
5. Given you have set up the YAML files correctly, the setup is complet.
