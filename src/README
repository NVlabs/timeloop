-----------------------------------------------
cnn/problem-shape.*
  Data structures to describe the shape of a problem, and routines to parse
  a specific shape (e.g., a CNN layer) into these data structures.

mapspaces/*
  A mapspace is the space of legal mappings for a specific architecture
  and a problem (e.g. CNN layer) shape. There are distinct C++ classes to
  construct mapspaces for different classes of architectures. The Uber
  mapspace is a generic class that can handle a broad range of architectures.

mapping/*
  A mapping is a specific tiling and scheduling pattern that can be used
  to execute a problem nest (e.g. a CNN layer) on a specific hardware
  architecture. This directory contains code to describe mappings, including
  nest structures.

loop-analysis/*
  Code to extract numberical properties of a specific mapping, e.g., shapes
  and sizes of operand volumes at each nesting level, reads/writes required
  to transfer sub-volumes of data between different different nesting levels,
  etc.

model/*
  Generic analytical model for a large class of accelerator architectures.
  Constructs a templatized model based on provided parameters. Can
  "evaluate" the performance of a mapping on the modeled architecture
  to emits various statistics such as cycle counts and access counts to
  various hardware structures. Relies heavily on the loop-analysis routines
  to do most of the heavy-lifting.

pat/* (external)
  Technology parameters and interpolation routines for Energy and Area
  modeling. Access counts from the analytical performance model can be
  applied on access costs derived from these parameters to obtain
  energy projections.

search/*
  Search routines used to find optimal mappings.

applications/*
  Applications using the timeloop infrastructure. The nominal "timeloop"
  application is expressed in applications/mapper.hpp.

compound-config/*
  A wrapper class to support both yaml and libconfig inputs transparently.
